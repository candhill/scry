What's the point of another photo album?
----------------------------------------

For my needs, photo gallery programs always try to do too much.  They
add all kinds of extraneous metadata, force you to use a web interface
to upload and manage photos, glom data (and sometimes photos!) in a
database, and generally complicate your life.  Photos are quite happy
in a normal filesystem, with a simple XHTML interface, image resizing,
and strong template support for inclusion in an existing site.

Scry is less than 500 lines of code, including configuration and
comments, contained in 5 source files.  It doesn't use a database.  It
has no administrative front end.  Change the filesystem and the image
views will change without interaction on your part.  Image resizing
and caching is done on the fly.  You can easily embed Scry into an
existing site.  Scry is stable, secure, production-tested, and won't
change out from under you in two versions.

If you're looking for more advanced photo album features, I recommend
Bharat Mediratta's excellent and comprehensive Gallery photo album
system (http://gallery.sf.net).

What's Required:
----------------

- PHP 4 > 4.0.6
- GD 2.X built as a PHP module

That's it!

How to Install Scry:
--------------------

1. Untar Scry-1.0.tar.gz into your webserver's document root:

   cd /path/to/webserver/document/root
   tar zxvf /path/to/scry/Scry-1.0.tar.gz

2. Create a directory for cached image files.  Set the permissions of this 
   directory so the webserver can create files therein.

   mkdir cache
   chmod 777 cache

3. Edit scry/setup.php; change the first six variables marked with 'CHANGEME'.

   $CFG_path_images    the directory containing your photos
   $CFG_path_cache     the cache directory you just created
   $CFG_path_template  the template subdirectory you want Scry to use
   $CFG_url_images     the URL to your photos directory (see also #1 below)
   $CFG_url_cache      the URL to your cache directory (see also #1 below)
   $CFG_url_album      the URL to your photo album, including index.php

4. Point your browser to /scry/index.php.

If all is well, you'll see directories and photos.

Configuration Notes:
--------------------

1. Note that Scry can publish photos within your webserver's document
   root or outside it on the filesystem.  If you set your 
   $CFG_path_images or $CFG_path_cache outside your document root, be
   sure to also set $CFG_cache_outside_docroot and
   $CFG_images_outside_docroot to true.

Known Limitations:
------------------

- Scry 1.0 has only been tested on Linux.  With correctly formatted path
  names, Scry should work without modification on Windows.
- Scry 1.0 supports only JPEG files.  Support for other formats is planned 
  for a later release.
